BirthdayPlaceholder
===================

This is a UITextField shouldChangeCharactersInRange delegate implementation that keeps the placeholder text displayed as the user types.<br><br>
Simply implement the delegate method and attach it to your UITextField.

In this fork I changed the date format from MM/DD/YYYY to DD.MM.YYYY.
